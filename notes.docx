I link to “what are you doing here” then set “i have no idea what to do with you” as the child of that

The mod plays “what are you doing here” then “i thought we had an understanding”
then it moves to “all denied to us because of zariel” and then “i have no idea what to do with you”

are the aliases grabbing onto lines they shouldn't be? Why?

What is lineid?

What is jumptarget?

What are rootnodes?
