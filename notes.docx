I link to “what are you doing here” then set “i have no idea what to do with you” as the child of that

The mod plays “what are you doing here” then “i thought we had an understanding”
then it moves to “all denied to us because of zariel” and then “i have no idea what to do with you”

are the aliases grabbing onto lines they shouldn't be? Why?

What is lineid?

What is jumptarget?

What are rootnodes?

Can take dialog from a different file, but very jank and doesn't play cinematic.

SE commands:

tavUUID = Osi.GetHostCharacter()
Osi.CharacterGiveEquipmentSet(tavUUID, "EQ_Astarion")

I feel this is not a great technique because it's harder to read. That's a huge amount of text and it would be easy to miss stuff. Here's a better technique: 
Run this before cut scene:
Ext.IO.SaveFile('host-before-cut-scene.json', Ext.DumpExport(Ext.Entity.Get(GetHostCharacter()):GetAllComponents()))
Run this after:
Ext.IO.SaveFile('host-after-cut-scene.json', Ext.DumpExport(Ext.Entity.Get(GetHostCharacter()):GetAllComponents()))
Then use https://www.diffchecker.com/ or a VSCode extension to compare them

The file will be in %localappdata%\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Script Extender - good luck!

entity = Ext.Entity.Get(GetHostCharacter())
print(entity)
